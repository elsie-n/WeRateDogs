# WeRateDogs
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.
Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

The data used;
The WeRateDogs Twitter archive downloaded from https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv

The tweet image predictions downloaded from : https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv

Additional data from the Twitter API used Tweepy to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive.
